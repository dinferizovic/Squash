# Squash Plugin
A plugin for the upcoming SquashMC server. *Early development*
# Warning
This plugin contains hard-coded features that need to be changed before compiling.
This will be removed later.
# Why open source?
We love open source, and we want everyone to be able to benefit from our plugin.
If you want to use this on your server, go ahead! It would be nice if you shot us a message with your server IP so we can visit :)
If you need help, don't hesitate to contact us!
